The dataset consists of 80,000 training images and 40,000 validation images, each annotated with 5 captions written by workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n","\n","**Image features.** We have preprocessed the data and extracted features for you already. For all images, we have extracted features from the fc7 layer of the VGG-16 network pretrained on ImageNet, and these features are stored in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7.h5`. To cut down on processing time and memory requirements, we have reduced the dimensionality of the features from 4096 to 512 using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and these features are stored in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5`. The raw images take up nearly 20GB of space so we have not included them in the download. Since all images are taken from Flickr, we have stored the URLs of the training and validation images in the files `train2014_urls.txt` and `val2014_urls.txt`. This allows you to download images on-the-fly for visualization.\n","\n","**Captions.** Dealing with strings is inefficient, so we will work with an encoded version of the captions. Each word is assigned an integer ID, allowing us to represent a caption by a sequence of integers. The mapping between integer IDs and words is in the file `coco2014_vocab.json`, and you can use the function `decode_captions` from the file `cs231n/coco_utils.py` to convert NumPy arrays of integer IDs back into strings.\n","\n","**Tokens.** There are a couple special tokens that we add to the vocabulary, and we have taken care of all implementation details around special tokens for you. We prepend a special `<START>` token and append an `<END>` token to the beginning and end of each caption respectively. Rare words are replaced with a special `<UNK>` token (for \"unknown\"). In addition, since we want to train with minibatches containing captions of different lengths, we pad short captions with a special `<NULL>` token after the `<END>` token and don't compute loss or gradient for `<NULL>` tokens.\n","\n","You can load all of the COCO data (captions, features, URLs, and vocabulary) using the `load_coco_data` function from the file `cs231n/coco_utils.py`.
